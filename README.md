# s5p6818_nsih
This Project mainly for s5p6818 boot header(nsih) binary generation. You can modify the assembler file for new configuration, and the default one will make all CPU cores run into Aarch64 mode after reset exception

A 32-bit cross compile is need because the default cores run in arch32 mode
